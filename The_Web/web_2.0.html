                <h3>TOPIC: Web 2.0</h3>
                <p>Behold, my contribution notes on Web 2.0.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                    I found myself already familiar with the entirety of the terms being used, but to pinpoint a few I could address would be copyright and authorship. Traditionally, copyright exists the moment you create something, and you have exclusive rights to it. If someone uses your content without your approval, you can take legal action to have the abuser revoke their usage, possibly pay a fine, or even be punished for misrepresentation of your brand, provided you can prove that you created the original content first and their content infringes upon your idea. Normally a smart thing to do is to register your creation with the copyright office to have them keep the record for you. Now, with the Web, if you upload it it is recorded. But these recordings can be falsified, like any form of media in digital technology. How can you confirm something is and has been yours with complete certainty?</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    With authorship, I'm certain you're all familiar with this. How often have you seen something reposted on Facebook from somewhere else without credits given to the original creator? If someone were to re-upload someone's content without providing source for the original creator, they are robbing that creator of potential gain from ad revenue and product sales. Admittedly, in order to sue there needs to be recognizable damages and quantifiable loss, and because the number of people who may or may not see it on the original creator's own platforms is hard to determine, it's also incredibly hard to determine how actually damaging anonymous reposting is to the artist. Because of that, many compilation pages or sites have dedicated followers who are all leeching off of someone else's original content without any kickback for it. It's hard to conceptualize because the idea of it being "lost product" is laughable since the content is available free for all.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    The best way to analogize this I have is that original creators are their own candy stores. They give out free "samples" of their work that anyone can enjoy and can create these samples infinitely. Whenever someone even visits their shop, without buying anything, the artist gets a small profit from the ad companies that have their product info plastered on the creator's shop. If someone buys a product from the creator, the creator gets the bulk of the cut since they are only advertising themselves and their brand. Meanwhile, large sites like Facebook, tumblr and reddit users, they can access these "free samples" by visiting the creator shop once. Then they themselves have their own candy stores with these free samples from hundreds if not thousands of other sources. People inevitably flock to these "megamalls" and gorge on the free samples, not realizing or worse, not caring, that the original creator doesn't get a cent from these people consuming their samples elsewhere, whereas if they had the address/URL to the creator's shop they could at least get some traffic. By disregarding proper crediting of authorship, creators are stiffed their profit and availability of a wider audience. While technically nobody gets hurt, there is someone else making money off of another's hard work without doing anything themselves. Ethically, that's abhorrent. People need to understand what appropriate compensation is, and act on it.
